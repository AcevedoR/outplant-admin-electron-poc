# outplant admin electron poc

A POC of **@xyflow/svelte** running in **electron** with **vite** for our [Outplant \(in development\) game](https://github.com/AcevedoR/outplant). It should launch an electron app and display a beautiful graph like this:

I don't know what half of the confs are doing, there is probably a lot of things to fix and clean, but at least it works..

## Running
```
npm install
npm run watch
```
